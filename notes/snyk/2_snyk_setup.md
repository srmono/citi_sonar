Setting up and scanning projects using Snyk on both Windows and Ubuntu involves a series of steps. Below are detailed instructions for each operating system.

### Windows

#### Step 1: Install Node.js
1. **Download Node.js**: Go to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the Windows installer.
2. **Run the Installer**: Execute the downloaded installer and follow the installation steps.
3. **Verify Installation**: Open Command Prompt and run:
   ```sh
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   Ensure both commands return version numbers.

#### Step 2: Install Snyk CLI
1. **Open Command Prompt**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit `Enter`.
2. **Install Snyk**: Run the following command:
   ```sh
   npm install -g snyk
   ```
3. **Verify Installation**: Check the Snyk version by running:
   ```sh
   snyk --version
   ```

#### Step 3: Authenticate Snyk
1. **Authenticate**: Run the following command to authenticate Snyk with your account:
   ```sh
   snyk auth
   ```
   This will open a browser window asking you to log in to your Snyk account or create a new one.

#### Step 4: Scan a Project
1. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Use `cd` to navigate to the directory of the project you want to scan. For example:
   ```sh
   cd path\to\your\project
   ```
2. **Run Snyk Scan**: Execute the following command to scan the project:
   ```sh
   snyk test
   ```
   This will display the vulnerabilities found in the project.

#### Example: Scanning a Node.js Project
1. **Create a Sample Project**:
   ```sh
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   npm init -y
   npm install express
   ```
2. **Scan the Project**:
   ```sh
   snyk test
   ```

### Ubuntu

#### Step 1: Install Node.js
1. **Update Package List**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
   ```
3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sh
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

#### Step 2: Install Snyk CLI
1. **Install Snyk**:
   ```sh
   sudo npm install -g snyk
   ```
2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sh
   snyk --version
   ```

#### Step 3: Authenticate Snyk
1. **Authenticate**:
   ```sh
   snyk auth
   ```
   This will open a browser window asking you to log in to your Snyk account or create a new one.

#### Step 4: Scan a Project
1. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
2. **Run Snyk Scan**:
   ```sh
   snyk test
   ```

#### Example: Scanning a Node.js Project
1. **Create a Sample Project**:
   ```sh
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   npm init -y
   npm install express
   ```
2. **Scan the Project**:
   ```sh
   snyk test
   ```

### Summary

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Required to install and run Snyk.
2. **Install Snyk CLI**: Globally install the Snyk CLI using npm.
3. **Authenticate Snyk**: Use `snyk auth` to link your Snyk account.
4. **Scan Projects**: Navigate to your project directory and run `snyk test` to scan for vulnerabilities.
