#### Widely-used framework that provides a structured and comprehensive model for understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries during cyber attacks. It's valuable for threat intelligence, detection, and response efforts. Here are some other frameworks similar to MITRE ATT&CK:

1. **MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge)**: Provides a structured and comprehensive model for understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries during cyber attacks. It's valuable for threat intelligence, detection, and response efforts.

2. **Cyber Kill Chain**: Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain outlines the stages of a cyber attack, from initial reconnaissance to exfiltration of data, providing a framework for understanding and defending against advanced threats.

3. **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis**: This model, developed by the security community, describes cyber threat intelligence in terms of four key elements: adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim. It helps analysts understand and visualize cyber threats.

4. **VERIS (Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing)**: VERIS is a framework developed by the Verizon RISK Team for standardizing the collection and sharing of security incident information. It provides a common language and data model for describing security incidents.

5. **PRE-ATT&CK**: This framework, also developed by MITRE, focuses on the actions that occur before an actual cyber attack takes place. It helps organizations understand and defend against pre-attack reconnaissance and preparation activities.

6. **ATT&CK for Containers**: A specialized extension of MITRE ATT&CK, this framework focuses on the tactics and techniques used by adversaries to target containerized environments, such as Docker or Kubernetes.

7. **ATT&CK for ICS (Industrial Control Systems)**: Another extension of MITRE ATT&CK, this framework focuses on the tactics and techniques used by adversaries to target industrial control systems and critical infrastructure.

8. **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Frameworks**: Various frameworks exist for organizing and analyzing cyber threat intelligence, such as the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) and the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII).

9. **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)**: While not frameworks in the traditional sense, TIPs provide tools and capabilities for collecting, analyzing, and sharing threat intelligence data, facilitating the use of frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK in operational environments.

These frameworks and models serve different purposes within the cybersecurity domain, ranging from understanding adversary behavior to organizing and sharing threat intelligence. Organizations often use a combination of these frameworks to enhance their cybersecurity capabilities and better defend against cyber threats.
