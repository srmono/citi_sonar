Checkmarx is a company that provides various cybersecurity solutions aimed at securing software development processes and applications. Here's an overview of the terms and solutions related to Checkmarx:

### Checkmarx Solutions and Terms:

1. **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**:
   - **Definition**: SAST is a type of security testing that analyzes source code, bytecode, or binary code for vulnerabilities without executing the program.
   - **Use**: It identifies security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, allowing developers to fix issues before deployment.

2. **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)**:
   - **Definition**: SCA is a process of identifying and managing open source and third-party components used in software development.
   - **Use**: It helps organizations manage the risks associated with vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and components.

3. **Software Supply Chain Security**:
   - **Definition**: This refers to securing the software supply chain, including processes, tools, and people involved in software development and delivery.
   - **Use**: Ensures that software components and dependencies are secure and trustworthy throughout the development and deployment pipeline.

4. **API Security**:
   - **Definition**: API Security involves protecting APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) from unauthorized access, misuse, and vulnerabilities.
   - **Use**: Ensures that APIs are secure against attacks and that access is properly authenticated and authorized.

5. **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**:
   - **Definition**: DAST involves testing an application during runtime to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
   - **Use**: Complements SAST by testing the application from the outside, simulating real-world attacks to discover vulnerabilities that SAST may miss.

6. **Container Security**:
   - **Definition**: Container Security focuses on securing containerized applications and the container runtime environment.
   - **Use**: Ensures that containers are deployed securely, with measures to protect against vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.

7. **IaC (Infrastructure as Code) Security**:
   - **Definition**: IaC Security involves securing the code and configurations used to automate infrastructure deployment and management.
   - **Use**: Ensures that infrastructure configurations are secure and compliant with organizational policies and best practices.

8. **Codebashing** (now part of Checkmarx):
   - **Definition**: Codebashing is an interactive training platform that provides developers with hands-on experience in secure coding practices.
   - **Use**: Educates developers about secure coding techniques and common vulnerabilities, improving their ability to write secure code.

Checkmarx provides these solutions and tools to help organizations enhance the security of their software development processes, from code writing to deployment, focusing on both proactive testing and secure coding practices.
