3. **Checkmarx IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing)**
   - **Purpose:** Identifies vulnerabilities during runtime by monitoring the applicationâ€™s interactions.
   - **Functionality:** Combines elements of SAST and DAST to provide comprehensive security testing.
   - **Integration:** Works with QA and testing environments to analyze the application while it is running.

4. **Checkmarx DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**
   - **Purpose:** Identifies vulnerabilities in running web applications.
   - **Functionality:** Simulates attacks on the application to find exploitable security issues.
   - **Integration:** Can be used in staging environments and integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

5. **CxCodebashing**
   - **Purpose:** Provides developer training focused on secure coding practices.
   - **Functionality:** Interactive lessons and challenges that teach developers how to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
   - **Integration:** Can be integrated into the development workflow to provide on-demand training.

6. **Checkmarx IaC Security (Infrastructure as Code)**
   - **Purpose:** Scans IaC templates (like Terraform, CloudFormation) for security issues.
   - **Functionality:** Ensures that the infrastructure defined in code follows security best practices and is free from vulnerabilities.
   - **Integration:** Works with CI/CD pipelines to scan IaC files as part of the build process.

7. **CxAST Central**
   - **Purpose:** Provides a unified platform for managing application security testing.
   - **Functionality:** Centralizes the management of SAST, SCA, DAST, and IAST scans and results.
   - **Integration:** Provides dashboards, reporting, and analytics for comprehensive security oversight.
