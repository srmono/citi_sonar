# Testing Types and Categories

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST):
1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual units or components of the software in isolation to verify that each unit functions correctly.
2. **Code Quality Analysis**: Analyzing source code to identify code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and other quality issues.
   - SonarQube fits here by providing insights into code quality and security vulnerabilities through static analysis.

## Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):
1. **Integration Testing**: Testing the integration of multiple units or components to ensure they work together as expected.
2. **System Testing**: Testing the entire system as a whole to validate its compliance with specified requirements and assess its overall functionality.
3. **Acceptance Testing**: Testing conducted to determine whether a system meets its acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.

## Other Testing Types:
1. **Regression Testing**: Testing conducted to ensure that recent changes to the codebase have not adversely affected existing functionality.
2. **Performance Testing**: Testing conducted to assess the performance and scalability of the software under various conditions, such as load testing and stress testing.
3. **Security Testing**: Testing conducted to identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses in the software, including penetration testing and code analysis for security flaws.
   - SonarQube can also fit here by identifying security vulnerabilities through static analysis.
4. **Usability Testing**: Testing conducted to evaluate the usability and user experience of the software, ensuring it is intuitive and easy to use.
